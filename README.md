This is my final project during the Technigo bootcamp in spring 2020.
-WEBBSHOP-

In my final project, I wanted to show as much as possible of what I’m into. UX/UI - design, content, and of course frontend development. Well, and another passion of mine, ceramics.

My biggest challenges have been the prioritization, and almost everything taking a longer time than expected. I've had to cut out a lot of details that I know makes a difference, but that's how it is sometimes. And I feel like I've learned so much. Not only about code but also about my self and what I really enjoy.

What I’ve learned
- What to think about when designing this kind of page. I’ve done it before but you always forget the tiny details. They are just as important as the big things. And even if you done the entire thing yourself its so nice to have everything figured out before doing it. 
- To plan and structure your project. It’s so easy to do the fun and easy things and push the harder things to later.
- How much time this takes.
- How much I want to continue learning.
