This project is about authentication, allowing user sign up and log in.

A user can sign up with a unique username and email, its details will be stored in the database and the frontend will then fetch the information and authenticate the user before he/she is allowed to see information only for logged in users.
We used Node.js, Express and MongoDb for the backend and React and Redux for the frontend.

We did this project through pair programming and used the live share in VSCode.
